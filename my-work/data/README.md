<h2>One week in my life represented in data</h2>
For this project I have chosen to collect data about the compliments I <b>receive</b> and compliments I <b>give</b>.

I collected the following data points:

- date
  - Tuesday to Sunday
- name of the person
- type of the compliment
  - personality
  - work
  - appearance
  - birthday related
- compliment itself
- the medium through which the compliment was given
  - life
  - WhatsApp
  - WeChat
  - Instagram
  - Facebook
  - iMessage

  Since I collected both the compliments I received and the compliments I gave, I have two data sets uploaded to my Github.
