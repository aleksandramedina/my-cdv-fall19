<h1>Aleksandra's Compliment Project</h1>

<h3>I chose to collect the compliments I give and receive because I wanted to do a project that's personal and would let me look at my own life from a different perspective and maybe learn something new about myself (which I did, and it turns out I am not a very compliment-giving person, which I <i>definitely</i> intend to changeü§ûüèº).</h3>
<br>
<p>I really, really enjoyed doing this project, and I have learned so much! The hardest part for me was the very beginning, because I struggled with the syntax and was a little rusty with my coding. However, now I feel much more confident! (Big thanks for the help during office hours; I really appreciate themüê£)</p>
<br>
<p>The end result turned out to be very similar to what I was going for, and I am especially happy with the middlespread; I think it turned out great! A good way to emphasize the difference between compliments I received and compliments I gave.</p>

<b>A small note for my datazine project to make sure it shows up correctly:</b>
I used these fonts (just to make sure they show up correctly on your laptop and my compliment card can be printed properlyüòá).
