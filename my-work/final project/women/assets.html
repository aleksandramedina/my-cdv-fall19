    <h1>Managing Assets</h1>
    <h3>Considers gender differences in property and inheritance law.</h3>
    <p>This categroy saw, in total, four reforms, the fewest of all eight indicators.
    Looking at the data points in each indicator where reforms occurred, and where they did not,
  shows the pace of refor and the remaining gap. In Managing Assets roughly 17 percent of the data
points still nedd to reform, and approximately 1 percent of data points reformed over the
10 year period. This shows that the pace of reform in this indicator is very slow, and there is still some
way to go.</p>
