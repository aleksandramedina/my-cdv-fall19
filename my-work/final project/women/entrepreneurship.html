        <h3>Analyzes constraints to women starting and running businesses.</h3>
        <p>Reforms prohibiting gender discrimination in access to credit are implemented through a variety
        of legislation ranging from nondiscrimination and gender equality laws to credit
      and consumer protection acts.
    Maldives, for example, passed the Gender Equality act in 2016 requiring financial
  institutions to ensure men and women have equal access to financial services and facilities.
The Democratic Republic of Congo also prohibited gender discrimination in access to credit, as did 23 other economies
from across every region bu the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
