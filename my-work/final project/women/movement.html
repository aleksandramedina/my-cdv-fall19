        <h1>Going Places</h1>
        <h3>Measure constraints on freedom of movement, including whether women can indepnedently decide where to go, travel and live.</h3>
        <p>Over the past decade, this category saw the second lowest number of reforms across all eight indicators with only nine.
        Afghanistan eliminated a requirement for married women to be accompanied by or have written
      permission from their husbands to get a passport.
    Côte d'Ivoire no longer requires all married women to provide a marriage certificate
  when applying for a passport, a burdensome step in an economy where many marriages are not formalized.
Iraq's new paspport law repealed the requirement tha women under 40 be accompanied
by a guardian when applying for a passport. Finally, following a decision by the constitutional court,
Kuwait amended its passport law so that a husband's consent is no longer needed for a married
woman to have a separate passport.
The Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Honduras, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Togo all reformed their
family laws to allow women to choose where to live in the same way as men.
Previously husbands had selected the family's residence and their wives had to live there.
Several of these reforms resulted from the Millennium Challenge Corporation's Gender in the Economy Indicator, which measures
governments' commitments to promote gender equality in low- or middle income economies using Women, Business and the Law data.</p>
