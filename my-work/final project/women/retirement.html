        <h1>Getting a Pension</h1>
        <h3>Assesses laws affecting the size of a woman's pension.</h3>
        <p>Over the past ten years, 22 economies equalized or are gradually equalizing the ages at which men and
        women can retire with full pension benefits. Additionally, eight economies equalized or are gradually
      equalizing the ages at which men and women can retire with partial pension benefits.
    Many pension reforms benefitting gender equality result from a push for greater fiscal sustainability.
  Finally, Bolivia, Jordan, malawi and North Macedonia introduced pension credits for periods of emplyment
interruption due to childcare.</p>
