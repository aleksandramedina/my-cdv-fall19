<h1>Women, Business and the Law Index</h1>
<br>


<h3>What's the <i>Women, Business and the Law</i> Index?</h3>
<p>To develop a better understanding of how women's employment and entrepreneurship are affected by
legal discrimination, <i>Women, Business and the Law 2019: A Decade of Reform</i> examines ten years of
data through an index structured around the economic decisions women make as they go through their
working lives.
The index explores how the economic decisions women make are affected by the law.
</p>

<h3>What are the report's major findings?</h3>
<p>The data shows there has been great progress towards legal gender equality over the past decade.
In 131 economies there have been 274 reforms to laws and regulations, leading to an increase in gender equality.
This includes the 35 economies that implemented laws on workplace sexual harrassment,
protecting nearly two billion more women than a decade ago.
But the average global score is 74.71, indicating that a typical economy only gives women three-quarters the rights of men in the measured areas.
This has yielded interesting results. Six economies - Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden -
score 100 in the <i>Women, Business and the Law</i> index, meaning they give women and men equal rights in the measured areas.
On the other hand, the average score in the Middle East and North Africa is 47.37, meaning the typical economy inthat region gives
women less than half the legal rights of men in the measured areas.
But there has been significant progress over the past decade. Ten years ago, the global average score was 70.06. </p>

<h3>Who complies it?</h3>
  <p>This work is a product of the staff of The World Bank with external contributions.</p>

<h3>How is the index calculated?</h3>
  <p><i>Women, Business and the Law: A Decade of Reform</i> employs eight indicators that are structured
  around women's interactions with the law as they begin, progress through and end their careers.
This way of looking at the data helps align different areas of law with the economic decisions women make
at various stages of their working lives.
The eight indicators are Going Places, Starting a Job, Getting Paid, Getting Married, Having Children, Running Business,
Managing Assets and Getting a Pension.</p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p><b>In the words of the Interim President of the World Bank Group, Kristalina Georgjeva,</b> by measuring progress over time and providing policymakers with a starting point for reform,
<i>Women, Business and the Law<i> makes an important
contribution to expanding equality of opportunity for women.
Ultimately, the data shows that laws can be tools that empower womrn rather than that
hold them back from achieving their potential.
By making the economic case, the report encourages governments to guarantee the
full and equal participation of women.
After all, the world is better off when it draws upon the talents of all its people.</p>
