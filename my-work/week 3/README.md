* <b>Waze traffic predictions</b> - I often change the time I leave my house according to the predictions on my Waze app, and ALSO change the path I take to get from point A to point B. Furthermore, if the traffic predicted is to heavy, I might choose not to go at all.
* <b>Weather app</b> - I base my plans for the weekend depending on the weather predicted on my app. If the weather is predicted to be great, I might book a trip somewhere nice and go on a hike!
* <b>Stock market predictions</b> - our economies and the values of all firms are incredibly dependent on the algorithmic predictions of their share values.
