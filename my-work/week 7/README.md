<h2>Finding the Perfect Dataset</h2>

Here are some of the more interesting datasets I found and could consider working on for my final project:

[[How The Internet Talks]](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=lol.win.omg.cute.fail.wtf&start=20071015&end=20170731&smoothing=10) This could be interesting since I could analyze the trends throughout the years in people's interests, and how positive/ negative is the information people post online.


[[What Facebook Knows About You]](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-what-facebook-knows-about-you) This could be interesting since I could track the changes in my life based on what Facebook knows about me. What makes it more interesting is how much Facebook knows about me given that I use it so rarely.

[[Dogs of New York]](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/dognames/) I LOVE DOGS!

[[School dress Codes]](https://pudding.cool/2019/02/dress-code-sexualization/) This seems like an interesting topic to research and see the social changes that go along with sexualizing how young girls dress, however, I'm not sure how much quantifiable information I could get out of this data set.

[[FRIENDS]] (https://thelittledataset.com/2015/01/20/the-one-with-all-the-quantifiable-friendships/) This might be my favorite data set yet & one of my favorite shows to watch, when I'm feeling down. :)
