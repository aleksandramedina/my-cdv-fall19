<h2>Finding the Perfect Dataset</h2>

Here are some of the more interesting datasets I found and could consider working on for my final project:

<b>I will be using this dataset for my final project: </b>[[Women, Business and the Law]](https://wbl.worldbank.org) A thorough dataset spanning 2009-2018 rating legal gender discrimination in the world. The dataset includes:
* country name & code
* year
* region
* income level
* WBL index (the total score given to a country for its laws regarding gender equality, 100 being the highest score representing complete gender equality)
* going places - examines constraints on freedom of movement
  * Can a woman apply for a passport in the same way as a man?
  * Can a woman legally travel outside the country in the same way as a man?
  * Can a woman legally travel outside her home in the same way as a man?
  * Can a woman legally choose where to live in the same way as a man?
* starting a job - analyzes laws affecting a woman's decision to work
  * Can a woman get a job or pursue a trade or profession in the same way as a man?
  * Does the law mandate nondiscrimination based on gender in employment?
  * Is there legislation on sexual harassment in employment?
  * Are there criminal penalties or civil remedies for sexual harassment in employment?
* getting paid - measures laws and regulations affecting women’s pay
  * Does the law mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value?
  * Can women work the same night hours as men?
  * Can women work in jobs deemed hazardous, arduous or morally inappropriate in the same way as men?
  * Are women able to work in the same industries as men?
* getting married - assesses legal constraints related to marriage
  * Is a married woman not legally required to obey her husband?
  * Can a woman be head of household or head of family in the same way as a man?
  * Is there domestic violence legislation?
  * Can a woman obtain a judgment of divorce in the same way as a man?
  * Do women have the same rights to remarry as men?
* having children - examines laws affecting women’s work after having children
  * Is there paid leave of at least 14 weeks available to women?
  * Does the government pay 100% of maternity leave benefits, or parental leave benefits (where maternity leave is unavailable)?
  * Is there paid paternity leave?
  * Is there paid parental leave?
  * Is dismissal of pregnant workers prohibited?
* running a business - analyzes constraints to women starting and running businesses
  * Can a woman legally sign a contract in the same way as a man?
  * Can a woman legally register a business in the same way as a  man?
  * Can a  woman legally open a bank account in the same way as a man?
  * Does the law prohibit discrimination by creditors on the basis of sex or gender?
* managing assets - considers gender differences in property and inheritance
  * Do men and married women have equal ownership rights to property?
  * Do sons and daughters have equal rights to inherit assets from their parents?
  * Do female and male surviving spouses have equal rights to inherit assets?
  * Does the law grant spouses equal administrative authority over assets during marriage?
  * Does the law provide for the valuation of nonmonetary contributions?
* getting a pension - assesses laws affecting the size of a woman’s pension
  * Are the ages at which men and women can retire with full pension benefits equal?
  * Are the ages at which men and women can retire with partial pension benefits equal?
  * Is the mandatory retirement age for men and women equal?
  * Does the law establish explicit pension care credits for periods of childcare?


[[How The Internet Talks]](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=lol.win.omg.cute.fail.wtf&start=20071015&end=20170731&smoothing=10) This could be interesting since I could analyze the trends throughout the years in people's interests, and how positive/ negative is the information people post online.
The dataset includes:
* count - the amount of times this phrase has appeared
* comment itself, however the program tracked comments no longer than three words long
* how many authors have used the particular phrase/ word
* example ID of a comment
* average score
* count subs

*note*: now that I have looked into the dataset a little more in-depth, I probably won't use it for my own purposes, because it is highly unrepresentative ("as of the end of 2015, the site’s visitors were mostly 35 or younger, and about 80 percent were male"), contains a lot of slang that would be difficult to filter, and the dataset itself is a little too big and overwhelming.


[[What Facebook Knows About You]](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-what-facebook-knows-about-you) This could be interesting since I could track the changes in my life based on what Facebook knows about me. What makes it more interesting is how much Facebook knows about me given that I use it so rarely.

*note*: this could be an interesting project, where my online identity and real-life identity could be compared. I tried downloading the tool to see all the information Facebook *knows* about me, but it doesn't work anymore (URL not found). I also tried downloading the Data Selfie tool, but that one seems to be taken down as well. Maybe I could do some data scraping myself? I think this might be a worthwhile project because, even though, it's based on my data, it would be relevant for almost anyone, who uses Facebook and is at least somewhat aware of data privacy issues.

>The general idea would be to use the data that Facebook *knows* about me, and recreate my life story. Then, for comparison, I could pinpoint, where Facebook was wrong, where it remembers better than I do, and where it was factually correct (and I remember well enough to confirm); and then draw conclusions on who Facebook thinks I am and what I like. Maybe an interesting visualization might be of the information I willingly gave Facebook vs the information I didn't give Facebook (or wasn't aware I was sharing this information with Facebook, e.g., information from my friend list or third-party applications).

[[Dogs of New York]](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/dognames/) I LOVE DOGS!

*note*: as much as I do love dogs, this dataset probably doesn't really give me a lot to work with.

[[School dress Codes]](https://pudding.cool/2019/02/dress-code-sexualization/) This seems like an interesting topic to research and see the social changes that go along with sexualizing how young girls dress, however, I'm not sure how much quantifiable information I could get out of this data set.

Here's a github link to the dataset: https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dress_codes

The dataset includes these data points:
* school name
* state
* type - (general category where all the different prohibitions are grouped)
* item
* prohibited - who does this rule apply to? (female/ male/ none/ both/ NA)

Although this dataset is specific to the United States, I believe it is quite representative of the larger Western sentiment about dress codes. There are some interesting and more meaningful ways this dataset could be represented, that would prompt some discussions, however, I do think that this is a topic that has been discussed quite a lot lately, so I don't know if my work on this topic would have any added value.

[[FRIENDS]](https://thelittledataset.com/2015/01/20/the-one-with-all-the-quantifiable-friendships/) This might be my favorite data set yet & one of my favorite shows to watch, when I'm feeling down. :)

*note*: Unfortunately, this dataset might not be that ideal. It just collects the minutes each character spends speaking to the other characters to directly deduct the strength of their relationship. It's a flawed approach and also a little bit of a boring dataset.
