<h2>Finding the Perfect Dataset</h2>

Here are some of the more interesting datasets I found and could consider working on for my final project:

[[How The Internet Talks]](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=lol.win.omg.cute.fail.wtf&start=20071015&end=20170731&smoothing=10) This could be interesting since I could analyze the trends throughout the years in people's interests, and how positive/ negative is the information people post online.
The dataset includes:
* count - the amount of times this phrase has appeared
* comment itself, however the program tracked comments no longer than three words long
* how many authors have used the particular phrase/ word
* example ID of a comment
* average score
* count subs

*note*: now that I have looked into the dataset a little more in-depth, I probably won't use it for my own purposes, because it is highly unrepresentative ("as of the end of 2015, the siteâ€™s visitors were mostly 35 or younger, and about 80 percent were male"), contains a lot of slang that would be difficult to filter, and the dataset itself is a little too big and overwhelming.


[[What Facebook Knows About You]](https://www.propublica.org/article/breaking-the-black-box-what-facebook-knows-about-you) This could be interesting since I could track the changes in my life based on what Facebook knows about me. What makes it more interesting is how much Facebook knows about me given that I use it so rarely.

*note*: this could be an interesting project, where my online identity and real-life identity could be compared. I tried downloading the tool to see all the information Facebook *knows* about me, but it doesn't work anymore (URL not found). I also tried downloading the Data Selfie tool, but that one seems to be taken down as well. Maybe I could do some data scraping myself? I think this might be a worthwhile project because, even though, it's based on my data, it would be relevant for almost anyone, who uses Facebook and is at least somewhat aware of data privacy issues.

>The general idea would be to use the data that Facebook *knows* about me, and recreate my life story. Then, for comparison, I could pinpoint, where Facebook was wrong, where it remembers better than I do, and where it was factually correct (and I remember well enough to confirm); and then draw conclusions on who Facebook thinks I am and what I like. Maybe an interesting visualization might be of the information I willingly gave Facebook vs the information I didn't give Facebook (or wasn't aware I was sharing this information with Facebook, e.g., information from my friend list or third-party applications).

[[Dogs of New York]](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/dognames/) I LOVE DOGS!

*note*: as much as I do love dogs, this dataset probably doesn't really give me a lot to work with.

[[School dress Codes]](https://pudding.cool/2019/02/dress-code-sexualization/) This seems like an interesting topic to research and see the social changes that go along with sexualizing how young girls dress, however, I'm not sure how much quantifiable information I could get out of this data set.

Here's a github link to the dataset: https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dress_codes

The dataset includes these data points:
* school name
* state
* type - (general category where all the different prohibitions are grouped)
* item
* prohibited - who does this rule apply to? (female/ male/ none/ both/ NA)

Although this dataset is specific to the United States, I believe it is quite representative of the larger Western sentiment about dress codes. There are some interesting and more meaningful ways this dataset could be represented, that would prompt some discussions, however, I do think that this is a topic that has been discussed quite a lot lately, so I don't know if my work on this topic would have any added value.

[[FRIENDS]](https://thelittledataset.com/2015/01/20/the-one-with-all-the-quantifiable-friendships/) This might be my favorite data set yet & one of my favorite shows to watch, when I'm feeling down. :)

*note*: Unfortunately, this dataset might not be that ideal. It just collects the minutes each character spends speaking to the other characters to directly deduct the strength of their relationship. It's a flawed approach and also a little bit of a boring dataset.
