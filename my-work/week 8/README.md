<h1>The Messy Truth About Social Credit </h1>

<h5> some notes and thougts </h5>

Last semester for one of my classes I wrote my final paper on the development of *smart* cities, where I also discussed China's surveillance state, the IoT and the power relationship between the general public and the influential few who *own* their data.

About the article >> here are some points that caught my attention:

 * interesting to bring up the skewed way the Western world looks at developments in China and its government; it is immediately viewed as a dystopia
  * "part of why the misreporting persists is because the United States and Europe project their fears about extensive digital surveillance in their own societies onto China’s rapid technological rise"
 * how do you measure 'trustworthiness'? who gets to measure it? who decides the definitions? does trustworthiness mean different things in different provinces? is it inheritable? (like, for example, the people who inherited their diseased relative's debt and got blacklisted for it)
  * building trust???? hmmmm, is the only way of building trust by creating the (maybe) illusion that you're constantly being watched?
    * "redlisting" LOL
 * "Taken as a whole, the range of goals that the social credit system aims to address may suggest that the government is itself unsure, and is still in the process of figuring out, what such a system can accomplish."
  * that's scary that there is so much gray area in a situation that could cause so much harm
  * in my opinion, probably the most alarming development that might start defining the gray area the government is currently in, are the partnerships between the government and Chinese technology firms that are being developed
  * a great point - the Chinese government hasn't yet asked for these firms to share their user's data (which it might just as well never do), but if the government did ask for this data, it would be incredibly difficult for the firms to refuse handing it over (interestingly: representatives of the companies’ senior leadership refer to their joint efforts as a form of social responsibility so they might as well *want* to share this information with the government)
   * further developments: if China embraces the marketization of blacklist data—so that data is bought and sold, like in the US—information about individuals would become even harder to track and contest
 * THESE ARE TRULY SHOCKING DEVELOPMENTS:
  * The enormously popular social video streaming app TikTok has partnered with a local court in Nanning, Guangxi to display photographs of blacklisted people as advertisements between videos, in some cases offering reward payments for information about these people’s whereabouts that are a percentage of the amount of money the person owes
    * Tik Tok does not disclose in their user terms that they work with the city
  * WeChat mini-app “Laolai Map.” This map displays blacklisted people, companies, and other organizations within a given area, alongside slogans such as “Recognize Laolai, avoid risks.” (not clear if real-location data or people's home addresses are used)
